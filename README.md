    After the services are up, create and apply the database migrations using the following commands:
    ```bash 
    docker-compose exec backend sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"

    docker-compose exec backend sh -c "python manage.py migrate"

5. **Create a Superuser**

    Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel by running the command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend sh -c "python manage.py createsuperuser"

6. **Collect Static Files**

    Collect static files for the project using the command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend sh -c "python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"
